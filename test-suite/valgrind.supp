# The primary goal of this valgrind(1) --suppressions file is to disable
# reporting of memory leaks (as defined by Valgrind) that prevent Squid from
# passing CI tests. Leaks in two major categories are eligible for inclusion:
# Acceptable leaks and Legacy bugs. See each category section for details.

# Category: Acceptable leaks

# We suppress reports about these memory leaks because we do not consider them
# problematic. They may disappear due to side effects of other changes, but we
# do not anticipate working specifically on their elimination. For example:
#
# * Leaked memory is allocated once per process lifetime and is never freed
#   (e.g., `static auto foo = new Foo()`).
# * Memory is correctly allocated and freed many times, but the last
#   allocation gets lost in cleanup during process shutdown.

# All allocations during static initialization phase. There are hundreds of
# them. Discovering new ones by tracking them individually is not worth the
# management overheads since the risk of a significant memory waste during
# one-time static initialization is very low. Other suppressions (implicitly)
# deal with allocations that happen after static initialization phase.

# Category: Legacy bugs

# We suppress reports about these memory leaks because we do not have enough
# resources to address them prior to deploying CI tests that expose them. We
# prefer to deploy CI tests with these bugs unaddressed because CI tests can
# detect _new_ leaks in code changes being proposed for Squid inclusion. New
# leaks are expected to be eliminated at pull request time, before they enter
# official code.
#
# We anticipate addressing these legacy bugs; each suppression in this
# category is essentially an XXX item for Squid developers. Some of these bugs
# may be addressed by reclassifying them as "Acceptable leaks" if additional
# research proves that we should not consider them problematic.
